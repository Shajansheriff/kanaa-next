  "description": "<p>TIUI is a simple procedure where we take the fast-moving sperm from the male partner and place it inside the cavity of the uterus, at the time the egg gets released.</p><p>So basically we bypass the mouth of the uterus(the cervix) and place the sperm a little closer to the egg! There onwards, the rest of the steps must happen naturally for a pregnancy to take place.</p>",

      "question": "Who can have an IUI done?",
      "answer": "<p>IUI may be offered to the couple if</p><p>a.the wife has at least one patent Fallopian tube</p><p>b.the husband has a sperm count of at least minimum of 5 mill motile sperms after processing</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "How many cycles of IUI can be tried?",
      "answer": "<p>Though there is no strict limit to the actual number of IUI cycles which may be done, the usual practice is to offer 3 to 6 IUI cycles depending on the couple's history and age. This is because the chances of success usually do not increase beyond this.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "Will IUI help if my husband's counts are very low?",
      "answer": "<p>IUI is a process in which the semen sample is processed to separate the fastest moving sperms as well as filter out the unwanted debris in the semen.</p><p>The count or number of sperms is not increased in any manner. Hence, if the sperm count is very less or nil, IUI is not the best treatment option as the pregnancy rates in such cases will be very low.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the process for using donor sperm?",
      "answer": "<p>Donor sperm IUI is an option offered to couples where the husband's counts are very less or nil and they do not want to go for or cannot afford IVF. The process is basically the same except that we use sperm samples procured from accredited sperm banks, which we inseminate in the cavity of the uterus. Informed consent taken from both husband and wife is a MUST. We usually match either of the partner's blood groups when asking for a sample but in case a request is made, certain physical characteristics like height, eye colour, hair colour, etc. can also be matched.</p>"

    {
      "question": "Should I take leave from work after doing an IUI?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have sex after doing an IUI?",
      "answer": "<p>Yes, you can continue with your regular sexual life after doing an IUI.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should we do single or double insemination?",
      "answer": "<p>Single insemination 36 to 38 hours post HCG injection, is sufficient in most couples unless the husband's counts are subnormal in which case, double insemination may provide extra benefit.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the success rate of an IUI?",
      "answer": "<p>World over the success rates of an IUI cycle is in the range of 8 to 14% per month.</p>"

    {
      "question": "What can increase the chances of success with an IUI?",
      "answer": "<p>Success rates are better</p><ul><li>when the age of the wife is lesser.</li><li>When gonadotropin injections are given to grow 2 to 3 eggs rather than.</li><li>When the husband's semen parameters are good.</li></ul>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What diet should I follow after doing an IUI?",
