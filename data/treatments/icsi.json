    "description": "<p>ICSI – the acronym meaning IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection – is a procedure that is often done together with IVF.</br> Confused patients often ask “What is the difference between ICSI and IVF?” BUT, these two treatments are exactly the same, EXCEPT for the method by which fertilisation is achieved. </br> In conventional IVF, the harvested eggs and sperm are mixed together in a Petri dish and incubated for a number of days. It is expected that the sperm will fertilise the eggs to produce embryos. However, this is assuming that the sperm are normal and active. </br> In ICSI, the egg is fertilised through the direct injection of a single sperm with the use of a fine needle. This makes ICSI the best procedure for patients with male factor infertility.</p>",

The wife has to come to the clinic at a particular time for daily injections or she can choose to self-administer the injections at home. Starting on day 5 or 6 of starting injection, another medicine called GnRH antagonist will also be added to prevent the eggs from getting released prematurely. So, you will be taking two shots in a day."

        "answer": "<p>Though there is no strict limit to the actual number of IUI cycles which may be done, the usual practice is to offer 3 to 6 IUI cycles depending on the couple's history and age. This is because the chances of success usually do not increase beyond this.</p>"

Hence, if the sperm count is very less or nil, IUI is not the best treatment option as the pregnancy rates in such cases will be very low.</p>"

        "answer": "<p>Donor sperm IUI is an option offered to couples where the husband's counts are very less or nil and they do not want to go for or cannot afford IVF. The process is basically the same except that we use sperm samples procured from accredited sperm banks, which we inseminate in the cavity of the uterus. Informed consent taken from both husband and wife is a MUST. We usually match either of the partner's blood groups when asking for a sample but in case a request is made, certain physical characteristics like height, eye colour, hair colour, etc. can also be matched.</p>"
