    "description": "<p>ICSI – the acronym meaning IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection – is a procedure that is often done together with IVF.</br> Confused patients often ask “What is the difference between ICSI and IVF?” BUT, these two treatments are exactly the same, EXCEPT for the method by which fertilisation is achieved. </br> In conventional IVF, the harvested eggs and sperm are mixed together in a Petri dish and incubated for a number of days. It is expected that the sperm will fertilise the eggs to produce embryos. However, this is assuming that the sperm are normal and active. </br> In ICSI, the egg is fertilised through the direct injection of a single sperm with the use of a fine needle. This makes ICSI the best procedure for patients with male factor infertility.</p>",

The wife has to come to the clinic at a particular time for daily injections or she can choose to self-administer the injections at home. Starting on day 5 or 6 of starting injection, another medicine called GnRH antagonist will also be added to prevent the eggs from getting released prematurely. So, you will be taking two shots in a day."
