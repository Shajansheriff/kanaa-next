  "description": "<p>Since the birth of Louise Brown in 1978, the field of ART has grown by leaps and bounds with exciting developments coming to the fore every year, all aimed at making the process safer for the mother. To put it simply, it is a process where we grow an embryo in the IVF lab and then replace it in the uterus.</p><p>Though commonly referred to as “test-tube baby”, it does not mean that the baby is actually grown in a test tube in the literal sense!!</p>",

      "description": "We use gonadotropin injections to make multiple eggs grow in the ovary, a process called controlled ovarian stimulation. The wife has to come to the clinic at a particular time for daily injections or she can choose to self-administer the injections at home. Starting on day 5 or 6 of starting injection, another medicine called GnRH antagonist will also be added to prevent the eggs from getting released prematurely. So, you will be taking two shots in a day."

      "question": "Why is IVF an expensive procedure?",
      "answer": "<p>The highly purified recombinant injections used for ovulation induction in an IVF cycle are very expensive by themselves.</p><p>The procedure to retrieve the eggs, the process of making the embryos, freezing them and the transfer involves a complex and meticulous combination of drugs, culture media, sophisticated equipment and technical expertise. That is why IVF is more expensive compared to the other treatments</p>"

    {
      "question": "What is the success rate of IVF?",
      "answer": "<p>Success rates in an IVF cycle cannot be generalized as they are case-specific and influenced by many factors such as:</p><ul><li>Age of the couple</li><li>Number of eggs obtained</li><li>Quality and number of embryos transferred</li><li>Presence of endometriosis</li><li>Quality of the sperm</li><li>Fresh or frozen cycle</li></ul><p>Worldwide the success rates are given as 30 to 40 % per cycle. When trying for 2- 3 cycles with cryopreserved embryos, this would then give us a cumulative pregnancy rate of 70 to 80% CDC has designed an IVF success estimator which can help you to roughly predict your chances.</p>"

    {
      "question": "What medications are used in ovarian stimulation?",
      "answer": "<p>Injections commonly used in an IVF cycle are:</p><ul><li>FSH - contains only follicular stimulating hormone. Mostly recombinant versions may be used depending upon the case.</li><li>HMG - Human menopausal gonadotrophins are preparations containing both FSH and LH in equal part.</li><li>LH - contains only luteinizing hormone in its pure form.</li><li>Recombinant HMG - contains recombinant FSH and LH in 2:1 ratio.</li><li>Cetrorelix or Ganirelix - these are GnRH antagonists given to prevent the premature release of eggs.</li><li>Hcg - Human Chorionic Gonadotropin is one of the injections commonly used to trigger the release of eggs from the follicles.</li><li>Leuprolide acetate - It is a GnRH agonist injection which may alternately be used as a trigger where OHSS is anticipated.</li></ul>"

    {
      "question": "How is ovum pick-up done?",
      "answer": "<p>OPU (ovum pickup) or oocyte retrieval is a daycare procedure where the follicles are aspirated transvaginally with ultrasound guidance in the operation theatre, under IV sedation given by an anaesthetist.</p><p>The embryologist examines the collected follicular fluid under the microscope and separates the eggs from it. They will inform us about the number of mature oocytes aspirated at the end of the procedure. The retrieved eggs are then placed in the incubator.</p><p>It is important to remember that not every follicle may contain an egg and that some may contain immature eggs which are not capable of fertilization.</p><p>Hence, the total number of eggs obtained may be lower than the number of follicles documented on ultrasound.After the procedure, you may need to stay for a few hours till the sedation effect wears off and can then get discharged.</p>"

      "question": "What is empty follicle syndrome?",
      "answer": "<p>It is a rare condition of unknown reasons where there are no eggs retrieved even after an apparently normal response to ovarian stimulation and a careful aspiration.</p><p>Genetic factors, ovarian ageing are some of the reasons known to cause EFS.</p>"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is OHSS?",
      "answer": "<p>OHSS is a potentially serious condition where the ovaries have been overly stimulated by fertility medications. The ovaries may increase in size and produce large amounts of fluid which then leads to pain and bloating of the abdomen.</p><p>When there is a strong possibility of OHSS as evidenced by the number of follicles, in PCOS or very high levels of serum estradiol, we may decide to adopt a policy of “Freeze all” and avoid fresh transfer to prevent serious OHSS.</p>"

      "question": "What tests are needed before IVF?",
      "answer": "<p><b>Pre-treatment cycle:</b></p><p>In the cycle or month preceding the intended IVF cycle, we do a set of basic investigations in the male and female partners.</p><ul><li>Tests for ovarian reserve like the FSH, LH, AMH, serology and routine blood investigations will be taken in the female partner.</li><li>AFC count on a transvaginal ultrasound may be taken.</li><li>3-D ultrasound or Diagnostic hysteroscopy may be advised to assess the uterine cavity.</li><li>Husband’s semen analysis and C&S will be taken along with serology and basic blood investigations.</li><li>You will then be asked to contact the IVF sister on day 1 of your withdrawal bleeding.</li></ul><p>These tests may be omitted in case you happen to have all the relevant reports ready with you (taken within the past 6 months) or may be done in your own country and mailed to us in case you are from out of India.</p>"

      "question": "How do embryos usually develop in a lab?",
      "answer": "<p>Embryo culture is the process following fertilization where the developing embryos are placed in a CO2 incubator and observed for subsequent development.</p><ul><li>Day 1 post-OPU - the formation of 2 PN (pronuclei) denotes fertilization success and formation of a zygote.</li><li>Day 2 post-OPU - The developing embryos should be at the 3 or 4 cell stage.</li><li>Day 3 post-OPU -The healthy embryos should be at the 7 or 8 cell stage of division.</li><li>In case we are doing day 3 transfers, we will decide on which embryos to transfer, freeze or discard at this stage depending on the number, quality of embryos and the endometrial thickness of the patient. This is a decision taken after counselling the couple.</li><li>In case of Blastocyst transfer, we will culture the embryos till day 5 posts OPU and transfer or freeze them for use in subsequent frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycles should the current one fail.</li></ul>"
