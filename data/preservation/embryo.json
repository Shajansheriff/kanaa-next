        "question": "Why is the endometrium thin in few women?",
        "answer": "<p>The lining may be unsatisfactory in one month and pick up in other months or with different methods of endometrial preparation as discussed before. In few women with persistently thin endometrium, we may have to rule out few causes like; </p> <li>Endometritis due to an active infection.</li> <li>Damage of lining due to previous genital tuberculosis.</li> <li>Damage of lining due to previous trauma or surgery.</li>"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is FET preferred nowadays?",
        "answer": "<p>The endometrial lining in an ongoing IVF cycle may be suboptimal due to a state of increased oestrogen production and hence where there are multiple follicles developing, we prefer to freeze all the embryos and replace them at a later date.</p> <p>Also, in such patients, we have the very important advantage of avoiding OHSS when we give an agonist trigger, freeze all and plan FET at a later date.</p>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What may be the cause of a too thick endometrial lining?",
        "answer": "<p>When the endometrial lining is more than 14-15 mm, the pregnancy rates may decrease and hence it is better to postpone transfer and rule out any pathology in the uterus like</p> <li>Presence of endometrial polyps.</li> <li>Presence of submucosal fibroids.</li> <li>Endometrial hyperplasia.</li> <li>Incomplete shedding of the endometrium.</li>"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the minimum and maximum duration of oestrogen intake in an HRT cycle when FET can be planned?",
        "answer": "<Though>A minimum of 8 days of oestrogen intake is advisable for adequate endometrial preparation. Though maximum duration has been reported upto even 40-60 days, usually we give for a period of 15-25 days before deciding to transfer or cancel the cycle.</p>"
