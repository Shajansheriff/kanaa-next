        "An instrument called a speculum may be inserted into the vagina to hold it open, although this is not always needed. The vagina and cervix are cleaned with an antiseptic solution. A hysteroscope (long, thin tube containing a light and camera) is passed into the uteus – you may experience some cramping and discomfort as it passes through your cervix.",
        "Fluid such as saline or glycine is gently pumped into the uterus to make it easier for the doctor to see inside. The camera sends pictures to a monitor so the doctor can spot any abnormalities if present.",
        "In some cases, a small sample of tissue from the uterus lining may be removed for further testing. This is known as an endometrial biopsy.",
        "If the findings of hysteroscopy needs to be treated such as fibroids or polyps, fine surgical instruments can be passed along the hysteroscope. These are used to cut or burn away the abnormal tissue.",
