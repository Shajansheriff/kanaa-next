            "answer": "<p>The most common reason for Hsg is to evaluate subfertility/infertility or repeat miscarriages .The main purpose of HSG is to evaluate for blockages of the fallopian tubes and it also provides information about the uterine cavity such as shape and presence of scaring, and also if there are any adhesions or scaring in the pelvis. There are other less complicated and more complete studies now available and can be done to study the uterus. HSG is mainly used to study the fallopian tubes.</p>"
