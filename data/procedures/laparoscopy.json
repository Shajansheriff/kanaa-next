        "The procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia and takes about 30 to 45 minutes. The abdomen is inflated with gas (carbon dioxide), then , the laparoscope is inserted through the small incisions. The surgeon views the interior of the pelvic cavity on a video screen transmitting the images from the camera. A dye called methylene blue is instilled into the uterus to confirm patency of tubes.",

Then it becomes an operative laparoscopy, and small surgical instruments are manipulated through the laparoscope or another small incision point and the problems found are corrected. The surgeon closes the incision in the abdomen with a few stitches. There is usually little or no scarring."
